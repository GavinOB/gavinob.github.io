# About
Hi, I'm Gavin. I use data to find and implement effective solutions to social problems. I work as the programs data analyst at [Community Servings](http://www.servings.org), a fantastic nonprofit in Boston that runs [local food and nutrition programs](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/08/27/group-aims-show-that-good-food-can-work-well-medicine/v56ARR3tYgTY2pSaGfSIRL/story.html). I am currently looking for volunteer data projects in the nonprofit or government sectors. Suggestions for non-data volunteer opportunities are welcomed, as well.
