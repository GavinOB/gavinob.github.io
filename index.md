# About
Hi, I'm Gavin. I use data to find and implement effective solutions to social problems. I work as the programs data analyst at [Community Servings](http://www.servings.org), a fantastic nonprofit in Boston that runs [local food and nutrition programs](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/08/27/group-aims-show-that-good-food-can-work-well-medicine/v56ARR3tYgTY2pSaGfSIRL/story.html). I am currently looking for volunteer data projects in the nonprofit or government sectors. Suggestions for non-data volunteer opportunities are welcomed, as well.

Passionate about social justice, I have a Master of Public Policy degree from the [Heller School](http://heller.brandeis.edu/) at Brandeis University. I serve on the core team of [Roosevelt Institute | Boston](https://www.facebook.com/RooseveltBoston), a city chapter of the national Roosevelt Institute that focuses on civic engagement among young people and upholding the principles of FDR's New Deal.
